      <value>A blockchain is a digital ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. It is constantly growing as &quot;completed&quot; blocks are added to it with a new set of recordings. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Bitcoin nodes use the block chain to differentiate legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere. One of its challenges is its high capacity requirements, as the entire blockchain is stored on each full node in the network. Also, the processing time for transactions is not instantaneous as it needs to be verified by each node in the network. The blockchain can be used to create a virtual economy, with virtual assets and virtual currencies. The blockchain can be used to create a decentralized marketplace, where buyers and sellers can trade directly, without the need for a central authority.addsee more</value>
