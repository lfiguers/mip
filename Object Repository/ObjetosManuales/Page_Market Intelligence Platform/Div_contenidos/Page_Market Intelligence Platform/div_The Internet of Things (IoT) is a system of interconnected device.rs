      <value>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interconnected devices, sensors, and software that collect and share data about themselves and their surroundings. The data collected by IoT devices can be used to monitor and control the devices, as well as to automate processes and make decisions. IoT devices are used in a variety of applications, including home automation, connected cars, industrial automation, and healthcare.IoT and Edge Computing are related because Edge Computing is a way to process data from IoT devices locally, rather than sending it all to the cloud. This can save time and bandwidth, and can be important for real-time applications such as autonomous vehicles.addsee more</value>
